The processes for flashing nRF52 and ESP32 devices are different.  The recommended method of flashing ESP32 devices is the Web Flasher, instructions for flashing ESP32 devices are locations [here]([https://flasher.meshtastic.org/](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/)), but users can also use the commandline scripts. 
For nRF52 devices, the "Drag & Drop" method is easiest. Instructions are located [here](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/)
